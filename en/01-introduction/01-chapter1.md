# Chapter 1 - Where to begin

I had been trying to start this book many years, but I really don't know where to start. 
Should I start with a brief history of Linux and his creator Linus Torvalds?  You can most properly learn more about Linus and Linux by doing a goodgle search.
Should I start with how to install Linux?  Install Linux is such a 90s thing where nowadays almost everyone will just spin up a new VM on AWS or Google cloud or Azure!
Should I start with Linux Filesystems layout?  In the modern day, with Terrabytes of storage on premise and in cloud, who cares about what is "/" or "/var" or anything underneath, as long as the services running is still running? 

So, where to begin?  That's the question!

Maybe I should start with just a simple explaination of what is Linux?
