Linux Administration Made Easy

This is a journal on how I learn (still learning) to do Linux Administrations.
This journal is based on my own experience as well as the works/blogs/knowledge of others around the world.

I hope this will be able to help any Linux enthusiast to start their journey into system administration.

I will share my notes and some of my codes/scripts here and there.
